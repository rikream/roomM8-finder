# 🛏️ Roommate Finder – Hostel Hackathon Project

Roommate Finder is a smart web application designed to help first-year hostel students find the most compatible roommates based on their lifestyle preferences and personality traits.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Collects student preferences (sleeping schedule, cleanliness, hobbies, etc.)
- Calculates compatibility scores between students
- Suggests ideal roommate pairings
- Simplifies room allocation for hostel administrators

## 💡 Motivation

Adjusting to hostel life is challenging—especially with a random roommate. Our project aims to ease that transition by helping students find someone they’ll get along with from day one.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Database:** Google Sheets via Google Sheets API
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code
